"Neurodegenerative disease and microbiota","Evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota, especially in the case of dysbiosis, may affect the progression of neurological diseases and may even lead to the formation of the disease. It has been realized that decreasing diversity in aging gut of the microbiota may be an important factor in the development of neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation is one of the major mechanisms that associate microbiota with agerelated diseases. Intestinal microbiota; plays a key role in the activation of microglia and it is suggested that manipulation of intestinal microbiota, especially withshort chain fatty acid producing bacteria, may modulate neuroimmun activation (Westfall et al. 2017). On the clinical and scientific level, most neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Disease related pathology may spread across the nervous system in a self-propagative fashion. Importantly, there is a strong bidirectional interaction between gut microbiota and the central nervous system, a connection recently termed the microbiota-gut-brainaxis(Jiang et al. 2017; Houser and Tansey, 2017). While the effects of the autonomic nervous system on gut physiology have been known for a long time, we are just beginning to understand that gut microbiota has strong effects on CNS physiology as well. The vast number of ways through which gut microbiota affects the host shows intriguing overlaps with pathways previously implicated in neurodegeneration. Although evidence for involvement of microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases is still very preliminary, initial findings are extremely promising (Zhu et al. 2017). This presentation will give an overview of recent findings regarding the connections between gutmicrobiota and neurodegenerative disorders and how this may reshape our understanding of these diseases."
"Coffee: Health effects and various disease treatments","To respond the growing demands for consuming natural foods, biochemical compounds originated from natural sources can be one of significant purposes for numerous researchers. In this review, we summarize the literatures regarding to the health effects of coffee consumption toward various human disease treatments, i.e., diabetes, cancer, liver diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. The consumption of natural products is being common and considered significantly, for example, the potentially functional features of biochemical compounds contained in coffee have significantly contributed to clinical treatments of different human diseases. The experimental and epidemiologic evidences are indicated in this review to probably contribute to elucidate the protective effects of coffee consumption on several human diseases; besides, it is not still certain whether the consumption of coffee should be recommended to patients in some cases. Moreover, the chemical features and health benefits of coffee are introduced shortly, which can support readers understanding in detail to the benefits and the roles of coffee compounds."
"Knowledge and behavior of community pharmacists towards detecting drug-drug interactions","Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are preventable medication errors that can cause severe adverse effects for patients, which often involve more than one mechanism. Healthcare practitioners, especially community pharmacists, must know and manage potentially significant DDIs to provide patient safety.
This paper mainly aims to determine the knowledge level of community pharmacists about DDIs and to evaluate the behavior of community pharmacists in detecting DDIs. For this aim, a face-to-face questionnaire, including a knowledge assessment test containing 20 drug pairs and ten behavior statements related to detecting DDIs, was applied to community pharmacists.
Seventy-three pharmacists participated in the study. The study’s findings show that the knowledge level of community pharmacists, who are the closest health consultants, about DDIs is relatively low. In addition, responses were found to be moderate in detecting drug interactions.Although statistically significant and positive effects of vocational training on the knowledge level and behaviors of pharmacists were determined, it was revealed that education levels did not have a significant effect.
In this regard, it is essential to improve community pharmacists’ DDI knowledge level through vocational training programs and encourage their interaction-detecting behavior to improve patient outcomes and patient safety."
"The interaction of neutron and gamma radiation with some cancer drug effect ingredients","In recent years, great advances have been made in cancer treatments with new treatment methods. Radiation therapy has an important place in cancer treatments and approximately 50% of these patients applied radiation therapy. In this investigation, fast neutron and gamma radiation, absorption characteristics were determined of pharmaceutical active ingredients such as Bevacizumab (Avastin), Camptosar (Irinotecan Hydrochloride), Capecitabine, Everolimus, Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin Calcium and Regorafenib which especially used in cancer treatments. GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation code was used in this calculates. It was found that Everolimus, Leucovorin Calcium has the best neutron attenuation capacity among the investigated drug effect ingredients. In addition to neutron attenuation properties, the gamma-ray attenuation properties of Oxaliplatin is found to good than other drug effect ingredients. According to the results obtained in the present work, we suggest that the Everolimus and Leucovorin Calcium drug effect ingredients by neutron radiotherapy and Oxaliplatin drug effect ingredients by gamma radiothrapy can be used both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In addition in study examined drug effect ingredients can be used for chemotherapy and radiotherapy combinaison at the same time so, cancer patients to be more effective treatment."
"The Effect of Interval Training Program on Nuclear Factor Erythroid-Derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2/Nrf2) Gene Expression in Women","Purpose in thiswork, to investigate whether interval trainingprogram has an effect on Nuclear factorerythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2/Nrf2)gene expression in women.The researchwas made on 12 women. Participantswere given a medium-term interval training program for 8 weeks, 3 days a week. Theblood samples of the participants were collected before and after the 8weeks of training. RNA isolation was performed using TRIzol Reagent fromperipheral blood mononuclear cells. NFE2L2 gene expression wasdetermined by Biomark Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR). The participants was a significant increase in heart rate andmaximal oxygen use capacity (VO2 max ) after the exercise (p<0.001). There was a significant decrease in the body weight and body massindex of women after the exercise (p <0.001). There was a decrease in NFE2L2gene expressions after 8 weeks of the training program (p <0.05,). It shows thatinterval exercise reduces NFE2L2 gene expression in women."
"Invastigation of 16S rRNA, mecA and nuc genes in coagulase-positive and negative Staphylococci by Real-Time PCR","Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, round-shaped bacterium that is a member of the Firmicutes. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. Sepsis-related to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has significant morbidity and high mortality rates (15-30%). The methicillin resistance for S. aureus is coded with the mecA gene, while the methicillin sensitivity is coded with the nuc gene, and they are chromosomal. Similarly, it is coded with the coagulase gene for S. aureus (Coa). In this study, the 16S rRNA gene identification by Real-Time PCR was investigated in forty S. aureus isolates, which were cultured at different times in terms of MIC and SIR tests. The isolates used in the study were determined at the gene level in terms of their differences in methicillin resistance gene (MecA), methicillin susceptibility gene (Nuc), coagulase gene (Coa) and in terms of intra-species differences were examined. As a result of the study, Staphylococcus spp. yielded positive results with 16S rRNA gene-specific primers in all isolates. Real-Time PCR analysis of the isolates with SYBRGreen-based PCR analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene-specific primers, and the samples were confirmed to be Staphylococcus. Analysis at the family level was followed by Coa, Nuc, and MecA gene Real-Time PCR results, and it was found that, in terms of Coa and Nuc genes, 19 isolates were positive and 21 isolates were negative. In terms of MecA gene, 16 isolates were positive according to the positive sigmoidal curves and to the single peak melting values, whereas 24 isolates were found to be negative. It was thought that this study will benefit the community by contributing to the rapid and effective diagnosis and treatment of infections caused by coagulase positive and negative Staphylococci."
"Inhibition effects of commonly used some antibacterial and antiviral drugs on purified human serum paraoxonase-1 (hPON1)","hPON1 is an enzyme from the group of A-esterases whichis capable of hydrolyzing the active metabolite paraoxon of parathion, anorganic phosphorus insecticide. It is an important liver enzyme that plays aprotective role against the hydrolysis of HDL-induced organophosphate agentsand nerve gases, oxidation of LDL, formation of lipid peroxides and bacterialendotoxins. The fact that oxidation of LDL constitutes the initial stage of theatherosclerosis process reveals the importance of the antioxidant properties ofthe enzyme. In this study, human serum PON1 was purified using three simplebiochemical purification techniques. Furthermore, the in vitro effects of someantibacterial and antiviral drugs on human serum PON1 enzyme activity wereexamined. IC50 values were determined."
"An application of CoFe2O4/alginate magnetic beads: drug delivery system of 5-fluorouracil","Magnetic hyperthermia therapy is expected to play an important role in the treatment of more and more cancers. The synergistic effects of using together hyperthermia and cancer drugs have been shown by literature studies to be more effective than either hyperthermia treatment alone or chemotherapy alone. In addition, magnetic materials that can be used as a contrast agent enable magnetic resonance imaging of the tumor, which is also useful in seeing the treatment progress. This study, which was designed for this purpose, occurred in three parts: In the first part, magnetic CoFe2O4/alginate composite beads were prepared and characterized with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the second part, the swelling behaviour of magnetic composite beads was investigated at pH 1.2, pH 7.4 and pH 6.8. It was seen that at pH 7.4 and pH 6.8, that is, near neutral pH, CFA swelled by 81.54% and 82.69%, respectively. In the third part, 5-Fluorouracil was encapsulated at the different ratios in CoFe2O4/alginate composite beads, and release experiments were performed at pH 1.2, pH 7.4 and pH 6.8. 5-FU release was calculated with Korsmeyer-Peppas, Higuchi, first-order, and zero-order models. It was seen that the drug release systems prepared were suitable for all kinetic models. Magnetic CoFe2O4/alginate composite bead, which is the drug carrier, was determined to be suitable for controlled release for 5-Fluorouracil."
